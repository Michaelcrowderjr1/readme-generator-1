## Repository
https://github.com/gehanstedt/readme-generator

## Installation
Install Node.js (recommend 14.15.0) from https://nodejs.org.  

Fork repo and clone down to your system.  

In the cloned directory, initialize Node package manager - npm init.  

Install npm package "inquirer" - npm install inquirer.  

If you will commit back to GitHub, recommend addding a .gitignore file to ignore directories node_modules and .DS_Store. 

## Usage
